> A handy mobile application (if you are a student at the University of Pannonia ) made using react native.
Its aim is to help (mostly first year) students navigate through the campus of the university, and to prevent forgotten lessons. 
> It is achieved by querying the students lessons then sending out a notification based on their exact location,the start of the lesson 
> and how much time it takes to get there. Hence, ensuring they will always be on time.
